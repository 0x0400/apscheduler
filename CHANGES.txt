Version history
===============

2.0
---

* Added configurable job stores

* Added optional job persistency

* Added job listeners (job execution, error, misfire, finish)

* Jobs are now run in a (configurable) thread pool

* Allowed configuration of misfire grace times on a per-job basis

* Allowed jobs to be explicitly named

* Maximum run count can be configured for all jobs, not just those using
  IntervalTrigger

* A maximum concurrency value can be configured for jobs, so only X instances
  will be allowed to run at once (will be considered a misfire otherwise)


1.3.1
-----

* Fixed time difference calculation to take into account shifts to and from
  daylight saving time


1.3
---

* Added __repr__() implementations to expressions, fields, triggers, and jobs
  to help with debugging

* Added the dump_jobs method on Scheduler, which gives a helpful listing of
  all jobs scheduled on it

* Fixed positional weekday (3th fri etc.) expressions not working except in
  some edge cases (fixes #2)

* Removed autogenerated API documentation for modules which are not part of
  the public API, as it might confuse some users

.. Note:: Positional weekdays are now used with the **day** field, not
   **weekday**.


1.2.1
-----

* Fixed regression: add_cron_job() in Scheduler was creating a CronTrigger with
  the wrong parameters (fixes #1, #3)

* Fixed: if the scheduler is restarted, clear the "stopped" flag to allow
  jobs to be scheduled again


1.2
---

* Added the ``week`` option for cron schedules

* Added the ``daemonic`` configuration option

* Fixed a bug in cron expression lists that could cause valid firing times
  to be missed

* Fixed unscheduling bound methods via unschedule_func()

* Changed CronTrigger constructor argument names to match those in Scheduler


1.01
----

* Fixed a corner case where the combination of hour and day_of_week parameters
  would cause incorrect timing for a cron trigger
